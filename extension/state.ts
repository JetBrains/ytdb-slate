/**
 * Canonical "provider/id" model-spec parsing — the ONE definition (CQ2).
 *
 * The pattern (validate, then split on the FIRST slash) had grown four
 * near-identical copies: failover.ts's local `isModelSpec`, and the inline
 * `indexOf("/")` splits in episodes.ts, worker.ts and the model router. All four
 * now call these helpers. It lives here because state.ts is where the config
 * vocabulary that uses it is defined (`episodeModel`, `modelFailover`,
 * `router.models`, the contextBudget override `match`), and because state.ts
 * imports nothing from those modules, so no call site can create an import cycle
 * by adopting it.
 *
 * ONE definition matters more than the duplication it removes: while failover.ts
 * kept its own laxer copy, two live predicates DISAGREED about the same config
 * string — the router rejected a spec with an embedded newline that failover
 * happily stored in its map and then failed to resolve, silently.
 *
 * The FIRST slash splits, deliberately: proxy providers legitimately carry a
 * slash inside the model id ("openrouter/anthropic/claude-..."), so provider is
 * everything before the first slash and id is all the rest.
 *
 * Whitespace, control characters and every ZERO-WIDTH or DIRECTION-CHANGING
 * character are REJECTED rather than trimmed (BG2). Such a spec resolves nowhere
 * in pi's registry, yet renders in a warning as a byte-identical twin of the
 * valid name once the display sanitizer strips the offending character — a
 * zero-width space, a variation selector or a right-to-left override is worse
 * still, since it survives sanitization and displays as nothing at all.
 * Rejecting them lets the caller say what is actually wrong
 * (describeSpecDefect). What is left after that is the VISIBLE confusable case —
 * a homoglyph such as Cyrillic "а" for Latin "a" — which cannot be rejected,
 * because an exotic provider id may be genuinely non-ASCII, so it is ANNOTATED
 * at display time instead (describeConfusables).

 * controls, word joiner and invisible operators, interlinear annotation marks,
 * the tag characters, and the BOM) — plus `Cs` (a lone surrogate is broken text,

 * cannot be loaded by the pure verification harness — it imports
